			  <h1>Bycatching</h1>
			  <p>
					Bycatching, in the fishing industry, is the act of
					unintentionally catching a certain target species
					or target size of fish or other marine life. <br/><br/>

					Every day, thousands of miles of nets and lines are
					set in the ocean to catch fish. Although this is essential
					for catching seafood we ultimately consume, it
					can be harmful for the marine environment. <br/><br/>

					Dolphins, sea turtles, and other marine life often get
					stuck in these nets and lines. When they are hauled
					up with the rest of the catch, these marine animals
					are discarded back into the water. These animals are
					often dead or dying when they are discarded.

				<h1>Impacts</h1>
				<p>
					Bycatching can have serious consequences.
					Endangered marine life, especially those already
					suffering from habitat loss, are at even greater risk
					for going extinct.<br/><br/>

					Bycatching not only affects fish, but also endangers
					populations of whales, dolphins, sea turtles,
					seabirds, and other precious marine life. Approximately
					200,000 loggerhead sea turtles are caught a
					year, with almost 700 killed in the U.S. alone.<br/><br/>				

					Environmental concerns aside, bycatching is also
					harmful for fishermen, as it damages their gear,
					reduces their number of catches.

				<h1>Solutions</h1>
				<p>
					Bycatching is a known problem throughout the
					industry, and many are taking steps to reduce it.
					Luckily, new technology allows for fishermen to
					reduce the number of bycatch, and to catch more
					of the targeting species and size.<br/><br/>

					Because of this, fishing is no longer poses a
					threat to the survival of non-target species. But
					the new technology is far from perfect, and not
					employed everywhere.<br/><br/>

					The continuation of developing new technologies
					to catch only the desired species and size is essential
					for solving the problem of bycatching, or at
					least taking great strides in reducing it.

				<h1>Take Action</h1>
				<p>
					There are steps you, as the consumer, can take to
					mitigate the effects of bycatching. <br/><br/>

					Tuna and shrimp are some of the most common
					types of seafood consumed in the United States.
					Unfortunately, they also create large environmental
					impacts, as the amount of bycatch for these two
					is large. Some fisheries that are the source for
					tuna and shrimp are more maintainable than
					others, however.<br/><br/>

					Check online to see which sources are more environmentally
					friendly. Try to avoid problematic
					fisheries, and promote sustainable ones. <br/><br/>

					Most importantly, get involved and spread
					the word!
